# Sydney Commute Skill

Plan trips, check real-time departures, and find stops across Sydney's public transport network. Works without API keys — best with a free TfNSW key for real-time data.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add agairola/life-skills --skill sydney-commute
```

## When to Use

Trigger this skill when the user:

- Asks about trains, buses, ferries, light rail, or metro in Sydney
- Wants to plan a trip or commute ("how do I get to...?")
- Asks about next departures, timetables, or platforms
- Mentions a Sydney station or stop name
- Asks about Opal fares or travel times
- Wants to find nearby stops or stations

## Prerequisites

- **uv** — `brew install uv` (macOS) or `pip install uv` (all platforms)
- **API keys** — not needed for basic links. Optional: TfNSW API key in `~/.config/sydney-commute/credentials.json` for real-time data.
- **Dependencies** — declared inline (PEP 723), installed automatically by `uv run`.

## Setup Status

!`command -v uv > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo "uv: installed" || echo "uv: NOT INSTALLED"`
!`test -f ~/.config/sydney-commute/credentials.json && python3 -c "import json; d=json.load(open('$HOME/.config/sydney-commute/credentials.json')); print('TfNSW API: configured' if d.get('tfnsw_api_key') else 'TfNSW API: not configured')" 2>/dev/null || echo "TfNSW API: not configured (zero-config mode — Google Maps/TfNSW links only)"`

## Location Flow

Follow the standard location resolution steps in [../../references/location-flow.md](../../references/location-flow.md) before running the script. Skill-specific additions:
- Extract from/to from the user message — e.g. "from Central to Bondi Junction" → `--from "Central Station" --to "Bondi Junction"`.
- **Never ask users for stop IDs** — always ask for place names. The script fuzzy-matches names to stops automatically. If the match is ambiguous, confirm with the user before proceeding.
- For departures mode, only origin is needed — e.g. `--from "Central Station" --mode departures`.

### Command Template

```bash
uv run "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/commute.py" [OPTIONS]
```

### Options

| Flag | Values | Default | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|---------|
| `--from` | station, stop, or place name | *(none)* | Origin location |
| `--to` | station, stop, or place name | *(none)* | Destination location |
| `--mode` | `trip` `departures` `stops` | `trip` | Query mode |
| `--depart` | `HH:MM` or `now` | `now` | Departure time |
| `--arrive-by` | `HH:MM` | *(none)* | Arrive by time |
| `--transport` | `train` `bus` `ferry` `lightrail` `metro` | *(all)* | Filter transport type |
| `--lat` / `--lng` | coordinates | *(auto)* | Explicit coordinates |
| `--no-cache` | *(flag)* | off | Force fresh data |

Only parse **stdout** (JSON). Stderr contains diagnostics only.

### Common Commands

```bash
# Plan a trip
uv run "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/commute.py" --from "Central Station" --to "Bondi Junction"

# Trip at a specific time
uv run "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/commute.py" --from "Town Hall" --to "Manly" --depart 14:30

# Arrive by a certain time
uv run "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/commute.py" --from "Newtown" --to "Circular Quay" --arrive-by 09:00

# Filter by transport type
uv run "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/commute.py" --from "Central" --to "Parramatta" --transport train

# Check departures from a stop
uv run "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/commute.py" --mode departures --from "Central Station"

# Departures for trains only
uv run "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/commute.py" --mode departures --from "Central Station" --transport train

# Search for stops
uv run "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/commute.py" --mode stops --from "Central"

# Zero-config (no API key) — returns Google Maps / TfNSW links
uv run "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/commute.py" --from "Central Station" --to "Bondi Junction"
```

## Presenting Results

Follow the formatting rules in [../../references/platform-formatting.md](../../references/platform-formatting.md). Key skill-specific formatting below.

### Trip Mode

Keep it simple — users just need to know what to catch, where from, and when.

**Simplification rules:**
- **Consolidate similar routes** — if multiple results are the same route at different times, show it once with a list of departure times. Don't repeat identical legs.
- **Lead with a practical summary** — one plain-English sentence describing the route, like a local would explain it
- Show platform numbers only for large train stations (Central, Town Hall, Wynyard) — users need these to find the right platform
- Always include short line codes (T4, T1, Bus 333) so users can find the right platform/stop
- Drop wharf numbers, sides (Side A/B), stand letters, and terminus descriptions ("City to Parramatta or Leppington")
- Only list distinct route options separately (e.g. train-only vs train+ferry)

**When all results are the same route (common case):**

For platforms with hyperlinks (Telegram, Discord, terminal):
```
Train → Ferry (~35 min)

Take any city train from Central (T1/T4, Platform 17 or 21) to Circular Quay (2 stops), then the Manly ferry (~20 min). Runs every ~20 min.

Next departures: 2:05 pm, 2:26 pm, 2:47 pm

[View on Google Maps](google_maps_url) · [TfNSW Trip Planner](transport_nsw_url)
```

For platforms without hyperlinks (WhatsApp, Signal, SMS):
```
Train → Ferry (~35 min)

Take any city train from Central (T1/T4, Platform 17 or 21) to Circular Quay (2 stops), then the Manly ferry (~20 min). Runs every ~20 min.

Next departures: 2:05 pm, 2:26 pm, 2:47 pm

Google Maps: [url]
TfNSW: [url]
```

**When results have genuinely different routes:**

```
Two ways to get from Central to Parramatta:

1. Direct train (~30 min)
   T1 from Central (Platform 16) to Parramatta · 12 stops
   Next: 2:10 pm, 2:25 pm, 2:40 pm

2. Metro (~25 min)
   Train from Central to Sydenham, then Metro from Sydenham to Parramatta
   Next: 2:15 pm, 2:35 pm

[View on Google Maps](google_maps_url) · [TfNSW Trip Planner](transport_nsw_url)
```

### Departures Mode

Show a compact departure list with delays highlighted.

```
Departures from Central Station:

14:30  T1 North Shore Line → Hornsby · Platform 16 · on time
14:32  T4 Eastern Suburbs → Bondi Junction · Platform 18 · 2 min late
14:35  T2 Inner West Line → Leppington · Platform 20 · on time
14:38  Bus 301 → Eastgardens · Stand B · no realtime
```

Highlight delays: if `delay_min > 0`, show "X min late" in bold or with emphasis. If delay is null and realtime is false, show "no realtime".

### Stops Mode

Show a list with transport types.

```
Stops matching "Central":

1. Central Station — train, bus, lightrail
2. Central Chalmers St — bus
3. Central Pitt St — bus
```

### Zero-Config Mode

When no API key is configured, show the fallback URLs as clickable links.

```
I don't have a TfNSW API key configured, so I can't get real-time data. Here are links to plan your trip:

Google Maps: [Central Station to Bondi Junction](google_maps_url)
TfNSW Trip Planner: [Plan this trip](transport_nsw_url)

For real-time departures and delays, you can set up a free TfNSW API key in about 2 minutes. Want me to walk you through it?
```

### Formatting Rules

- Trip mode: consolidate same-route results into one block with departure times, lead with a plain-English summary, include line codes (T1/T4) and platform at large stations, only list distinct routes separately
- Departures mode: compact time-based list, highlight delays
- Stops mode: numbered list with transport types
- Zero-config: show URLs as clickable links with upgrade nudge
- Google Maps and TfNSW links for each journey
- Real-time indicators: show "on time", "X min late", or "no realtime"

## Handling Edge Cases

- **No API key**: Return zero-config fallback with Google Maps / TfNSW URLs. Always works.
- **Invalid API key** (`401`): Show error with registration URL. "Your TfNSW API key appears to be invalid. You can get a new one at opendata.transport.nsw.gov.au"
- **Ambiguous stop** (multiple matches in departures mode): The script uses the first match and logs alternatives to stderr. If the JSON shows an unexpected stop name, tell the user and suggest alternatives.
- **No results**: "No trips/departures found. Try a different time or check the stop name."
- **Low confidence location** (`confidence: "low"`): Tell the user their location was detected via IP and may not be accurate. Ask for their suburb or station.
- **API errors**: Show the error message from the JSON response. Suggest trying again or checking the stop name.

## Upgrade Nudge

In zero-config mode (no API key), always append an upgrade suggestion. This is shown automatically since the API key is required for any real data.

**When to show:** Every time the JSON response has `"api_key_configured": false`.

**What to say (adapt to tone, don't copy verbatim):**

For platforms with hyperlinks:
```
Tip: For real-time departures, delays, and trip planning, you can register for a free TfNSW API key (~2 minutes):

1. Sign up at [opendata.transport.nsw.gov.au](https://opendata.transport.nsw.gov.au) — name + email
2. Create an application (any name, e.g. "Commute Helper")
3. Subscribe to "Trip Planner APIs" (free: 60,000 calls/day)
4. Copy your API key and share it with me — I'll save it securely.
```

For platforms without hyperlinks:
```
Tip: For real-time data, register for a free TfNSW API key (~2 minutes):

1. Sign up at opendata.transport.nsw.gov.au
2. Create an application (any name works)
3. Subscribe to "Trip Planner APIs" (free tier)
4. Copy your API key and share it with me.
```

**When the user provides a key**, save it securely:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/sydney-commute
cat > ~/.config/sydney-commute/credentials.json << 'CREDS'
{
  "tfnsw_api_key": "<key>"
}
CREDS
chmod 600 ~/.config/sydney-commute/credentials.json
```

Then confirm: "Key saved securely. Future commute queries will use real-time TfNSW data."

**Do NOT show the nudge if:**
- TfNSW API is already configured (check setup status above)
- You've already shown the nudge in this conversation

### Transport Types

| Product Class | Type |
|--------------|------|
| 1 | Train |
| 4 | Light Rail |
| 5 | Bus |
| 7 | Coach |
| 9 | Ferry |
| 11 | School Bus |
| 99, 100 | Walk |

### Stop ID Format (internal — script handles automatically)

TfNSW stop IDs are numeric strings used internally by the API. Users always provide place names — the script resolves names to IDs automatically via the stop_finder API. Never ask users for stop IDs.

### Script Location Fallback (internal — for reference only)

When the script runs, it resolves location internally in this order:

1. **Explicit args** — `--lat`/`--lng` (Nominatim reverse geocoding)
2. **From arg** — `--from` value forward-geocoded if it looks like a place name
3. **Browser consent** — localhost page requesting `navigator.geolocation` (WiFi, ~15-50ft accuracy, cached 24hrs)
4. **IP geolocation** — ip-api.com (city-level only, often inaccurate for non-city users)

The agent should almost never reach step 4. The Location Flow above ensures the user provides location info before the script runs.
