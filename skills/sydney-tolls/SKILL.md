# Sydney Tolls Skill

Check toll road prices and calculate route toll costs across Sydney's motorway network. Zero config — no API keys, no setup.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add agairola/life-skills --skill sydney-tolls
```

## When to Use

Trigger this skill when the user:

- Asks about toll prices or toll costs on Sydney roads
- Mentions a specific toll road (M2, M4, M5, M7, M8, M6, NorthConnex, Eastern Distributor, etc.)
- Asks about Sydney Harbour Bridge or Harbour Tunnel tolls
- Wants to know how much tolls will cost for a trip
- Asks about cheapest route, toll calculator, or total toll cost
- Mentions E-Tag, Linkt, E-Toll, or toll registration
- Asks about peak vs off-peak toll pricing
- Wants to compare toll costs for different vehicle types

## Prerequisites

- **uv** — `brew install uv` (macOS) or `pip install uv` (all platforms)
- **API keys** — not needed. Fully zero-config. Toll data is embedded in the script.
- **Dependencies** — declared inline (PEP 723), installed automatically by `uv run`.

## Setup Status

!`command -v uv > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo "uv: installed" || echo "uv: NOT INSTALLED"`

## Command Template

```bash
uv run "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/tolls.py" [OPTIONS]
```

## Options

| Flag | Values | Default | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|---------|
| `--road` | toll road name (string) | — | Search for a specific toll road by name (fuzzy match) |
| `--from` | place name (string) | — | Origin for route toll calculation |
| `--to` | place name (string) | — | Destination for route toll calculation |
| `--vehicle` | `car` `motorcycle` `heavy` | `car` | Vehicle type |
| `--time` | `peak` `offpeak` `weekend` | *(auto-detect)* | Time period for pricing |
| `--all` | *(flag)* | on (default mode) | List all toll roads |
| `--no-cache` | *(flag)* | off | Force fresh geocoding data |

Only parse **stdout** (JSON). Stderr contains diagnostics only.

## Common Commands

```bash
# List all toll roads with current prices (default)
uv run "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/tolls.py"

# Search for a specific toll road
uv run "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/tolls.py" --road "M2"

# Harbour Bridge toll
uv run "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/tolls.py" --road "Harbour Bridge"

# Calculate route tolls
uv run "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/tolls.py" --from "Parramatta" --to "Sydney Airport"

# Route tolls for a motorcycle at peak time
uv run "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/tolls.py" --from "Hornsby" --to "Sydney CBD" --vehicle motorcycle --time peak

# Heavy vehicle tolls
uv run "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/tolls.py" --road "NorthConnex" --vehicle heavy

# Weekend pricing for all roads
uv run "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/tolls.py" --time weekend

# Specific time period
uv run "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/tolls.py" --road "M4" --time offpeak
```

## Presenting Results

Follow the formatting rules in [../../references/platform-formatting.md](../../references/platform-formatting.md). Key skill-specific formatting below.

### Single Road Result

```
M2 Hills Motorway — $8.49 (peak, car)

Operator: Transurban
Direction: Both directions
Peak: Mon-Fri 6:30-9:30am, 4-7pm. E-TAG or cash/license plate matching.

All prices (car):
  Peak: $8.49
  Off-peak: $5.77
  Weekend: $5.77

Tip: Get an E-Tag from Linkt (linkt.com.au) or E-Toll (myetoll.com.au) to avoid the ~$0.55 license plate matching fee.
```

### Route Result

```
Tolls from Parramatta to Sydney Airport (peak, car):

1. M4 Motorway (WestConnex) — $9.44
2. M5 East Motorway — $5.67

Total tolls: $15.11

Note: This is an estimate based on the straight-line route. Actual tolls depend on your exact route and entry/exit points.

Tip: Get an E-Tag from Linkt or E-Toll to avoid the ~$0.55 per-trip license plate matching fee.
```

Currently showing: peak prices

```

### Formatting Rules

- Show the dollar amount prominently after the road name
- Include the time period and vehicle type in the summary
- For route calculations, number the toll roads and show a total
- Always mention if a toll is one-direction only
- Note distance-based tolls show the maximum price
- Include the E-Tag/Linkt tip in every response
- For motorcycles on the Harbour Bridge/Tunnel, highlight that it's free

## Handling Edge Cases

- **No matching road**: Show the error with a list of all available toll road names so the user can pick the right one.
- **Incomplete route** (only --from or only --to): Show error asking for both origin and destination.
- **Geocoding failure**: "Could not find that location. Try a more specific place name (e.g., 'Parramatta NSW' instead of just 'Parra')."
- **No tolls on route**: "No toll roads found on the direct route between [from] and [to]. Your trip may be toll-free, or the actual driving route may differ from the straight line — check Google Maps for the exact route."
- **M5 cashback**: When showing M5 East or M5 South-West, always mention the M5 cashback scheme for NSW-registered cars.
- **NorthConnex heavy vehicles**: When showing NorthConnex for heavy vehicles, emphasise that heavy vehicles are banned from Pennant Hills Road and must use NorthConnex.

### Data Source

Toll prices are embedded in the script based on published rates from NSW Government and toll road operators (Transurban, Transport for NSW, Interlink Roads). Prices are maximum rates — distance-based tolls (M4, M5, M7, M8, M6) may be lower for shorter trips. No user data is sent to any service beyond place names for geocoding (Nominatim/OpenStreetMap) when using --from/--to.
