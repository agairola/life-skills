# Sydney Traffic Skill

Check live traffic incidents, roadworks, and hazards in Sydney. Works without API keys — best with a free TfNSW key for real-time incident data.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add agairola/life-skills --skill sydney-traffic
```

## When to Use

Trigger this skill when the user:

- Asks about traffic jams, congestion, or road conditions
- Wants to know about road closures or accidents
- Asks about roadworks or construction on roads
- Mentions a specific Sydney road or highway (M5, M2, Pacific Highway, etc.)
- Says "how's the traffic" or "any traffic on the way to..."
- Asks about fires or floods affecting roads
- Wants to check traffic before a commute or trip

## Prerequisites

- **uv** — `brew install uv` (macOS) or `pip install uv` (all platforms)
- **API keys** — not needed for basic links. Optional: TfNSW API key in `~/.config/sydney-traffic/credentials.json` for real-time data.
- **Dependencies** — declared inline (PEP 723), installed automatically by `uv run`.

## Setup Status

!`command -v uv > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo "uv: installed" || echo "uv: NOT INSTALLED"`
!`test -f ~/.config/sydney-traffic/credentials.json && python3 -c "import json; d=json.load(open('$HOME/.config/sydney-commute/credentials.json')); print('TfNSW API: configured' if d.get('tfnsw_api_key') else 'TfNSW API: not configured')" 2>/dev/null || echo "TfNSW API: not configured (zero-config mode — Live Traffic NSW/Google Maps links only)"`

## Location Flow

Follow the standard location resolution steps in [../../references/location-flow.md](../../references/location-flow.md) before running the script. Skill-specific additions:
- If the user mentioned a specific road, use `--road` with a location.

### Command Template

```bash
uv run "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/traffic.py" [LOCATION_FLAGS] [OPTIONS]
```

### Options

| Flag | Values | Default | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|---------|
| `--location` | suburb/city name | — | Find incidents near a place name |
| `--lat` | latitude (float) | — | Latitude for nearby search |
| `--lng` | longitude (float) | — | Longitude for nearby search |
| `--radius` | km (integer) | `10` | Search radius for nearby mode |
| `--type` | `incident` `roadwork` `fire` `flood` `all` | `all` | Hazard type filter |
| `--road` | road name (string) | — | Filter by road name (fuzzy match) |
| `--no-cache` | *(flag)* | off | Force fresh data |

Only parse **stdout** (JSON). Stderr contains diagnostics only.

### Common Commands

```bash
# Nearby incidents (auto-detect location)
uv run "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/traffic.py"

# Incidents near a suburb
uv run "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/traffic.py" --location "Parramatta NSW"

# User shared location via chat platform
uv run "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/traffic.py" --lat -33.87 --lng 151.21

# Only roadworks
uv run "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/traffic.py" --location "Sydney CBD" --type roadwork

# Filter by road name
uv run "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/traffic.py" --location "Arncliffe" --road "M5"

# Wider search radius
uv run "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/traffic.py" --location "Penrith" --radius 20

# Zero-config (no API key) — returns Live Traffic NSW / Google Maps links
uv run "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/traffic.py" --location "Sydney"
```

## Presenting Results

Follow the formatting rules in [../../references/platform-formatting.md](../../references/platform-formatting.md). Key skill-specific formatting below.

### With API Key: Hazard List

For platforms with hyperlinks (Telegram, Discord, terminal):
```
Traffic near Parramatta (within 10 km):

1. Crash on M4 Western Motorway — 2.3 km away
   Allow extra travel time. Use alternative route.
   [Live Traffic NSW](https://www.livetraffic.com/)

2. Roadwork on Church St — 3.1 km away
   Expect delays. Reduced speed limit in place.
   [Live Traffic NSW](https://www.livetraffic.com/)

3. Flooding on James Ruse Dr — 5.7 km away
   Road closed. Avoid the area.
   [Live Traffic NSW](https://www.livetraffic.com/)

3 incidents found within 10 km
```

For platforms without hyperlinks (WhatsApp, Signal, SMS):
```
Traffic near Parramatta (within 10 km):

1. Crash on M4 Western Motorway — 2.3 km away
   Allow extra travel time. Use alternative route.
   Live Traffic NSW: https://www.livetraffic.com/

2. Roadwork on Church St — 3.1 km away
   Expect delays. Reduced speed limit in place.

3. Flooding on James Ruse Dr — 5.7 km away
   Road closed. Avoid the area.

3 incidents found within 10 km
```

### Zero-Config Mode

When no API key is configured, show the fallback URLs as clickable links.

```
I don't have a TfNSW API key configured, so I can't get real-time incident data. Here are links to check traffic:

Live Traffic NSW: [Live Traffic](https://www.livetraffic.com/)
Google Maps (traffic layer): [View Traffic](google_maps_traffic_url)

For real-time traffic incidents and hazard data, you can set up a free TfNSW API key in about 2 minutes. Want me to walk you through it?
```

### Formatting Rules

- Show hazards sorted by distance (nearest first)
- Include headline, road names, advice, and distance
- For road-filtered results, mention which road was filtered
- No results: "No traffic incidents found within [radius] km. Roads look clear!"
- Google Maps traffic link always available (shows traffic layer)
- Live Traffic NSW link for detailed info

## Handling Edge Cases

- **No API key**: Return zero-config fallback with Live Traffic NSW / Google Maps URLs. Always works.
- **Invalid API key** (`401`): Show error with registration URL. "Your TfNSW API key appears to be invalid. You can get a new one at opendata.transport.nsw.gov.au"
- **No results** (empty hazards): "No traffic incidents found within [radius] km of [location]. Roads look clear! You can also check Live Traffic NSW for the latest updates."
- **Low confidence location** (`confidence: "low"`): Do not silently show results. Tell the user: "I got an approximate location of [city] but it may not be exact. What suburb or postcode are you near?" Rerun with their answer.
- **API errors**: "Couldn't get traffic data right now. The TfNSW API may be temporarily unavailable — try again in a few minutes. In the meantime, check Live Traffic NSW: https://www.livetraffic.com/"

## Upgrade Nudge

In zero-config mode (no API key), always append an upgrade suggestion. This is shown automatically since the API key is required for real-time incident data.

**When to show:** Every time the JSON response has `"api_key_configured": false`.

**What to say (adapt to tone, don't copy verbatim):**

For platforms with hyperlinks:
```
Tip: For real-time traffic incidents and hazard alerts, you can register for a free TfNSW API key (~2 minutes):

1. Sign up at [opendata.transport.nsw.gov.au](https://opendata.transport.nsw.gov.au) — name + email
2. Create an application (any name, e.g. "Traffic Helper")
3. Subscribe to "Traffic" APIs (free)
4. Copy your API key and share it with me — I'll save it securely.
```

For platforms without hyperlinks:
```
Tip: For real-time traffic data, register for a free TfNSW API key (~2 minutes):

1. Sign up at opendata.transport.nsw.gov.au
2. Create an application (any name works)
3. Subscribe to "Traffic" APIs (free tier)
4. Copy your API key and share it with me.
```

**When the user provides a key**, save it securely (same file as sydney-commute):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/sydney-commute
cat > ~/.config/sydney-traffic/credentials.json << 'CREDS'
{
  "tfnsw_api_key": "<key>"
}
CREDS
chmod 600 ~/.config/sydney-traffic/credentials.json
```

Then confirm: "Key saved securely. Future traffic queries will use real-time TfNSW data."

**Do NOT show the nudge if:**
- TfNSW API is already configured (check setup status above)
- You've already shown the nudge in this conversation

## Reference

### Hazard Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| incident | Crashes, breakdowns, lane closures |
| roadwork | Planned and active roadworks |
| fire | Bushfires and grass fires affecting roads |
| flood | Flooding and water over roads |

### Data Source

All data comes from the NSW Government Transport for NSW Live Traffic API. Requires a free TfNSW API key for real-time data. Without a key, fallback links to Live Traffic NSW and Google Maps traffic layer are provided. No user data is sent to any service beyond coordinates for geocoding.

### Script Location Fallback (internal — for reference only)

When the script runs, it resolves location internally in this order:

1. **Explicit args** — `--lat`/`--lng` or `--location` (Nominatim geocoding)
2. **Browser consent** — localhost page requesting `navigator.geolocation` (WiFi, ~15-50ft accuracy, cached 24hrs)
3. **IP geolocation** — ip-api.com (city-level only, often inaccurate for non-city users)

The agent should almost never reach step 3. The Location Flow above ensures the user provides location info before the script runs.
